Getting Started
===============

Loading a Basic Spectrum
------------------------

Lets start by loading a test spectrum. If you followed the steps in
:ref:`specviz-launching`, you should see the specviz window up, but without a
spectrum.



Exporting Spectra
-----------------

A user can export a given spectrum in the data list by highlighting the
spectrum and clicking the ``Export Data`` button in the main toolbar. This
will provide the user with a save file dialog where they may choose where to
save the exported spectrum.

.. note::

    `ECSV <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.io.ascii.Ecsv.html>`_
    is currently the only supported export format. This will change in the
    future as more exporting formats are supported in the specutils package.
